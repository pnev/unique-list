### Unique List

Your assignment for this is to get the specs passing by implementing a `UniqueList` class. The specs describe the expected behavior.

An **important** note: You can not use an Array to store the values of the `UniqueList`! Though the `#values` method does return an array, you should **not** be storing the content of the `UniqueList` in an array. You can build an array inside of `#values` to use as a return value, but that is the only Array you should use.

### Running the tests
- Install Bunder `gem install bundler`
- `cd` into the directory where you cloned this repository
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec rspec unique_list_spec.rb`

Tests should run and, at first, all fail!
